# Operating system

A layer of software interposed between application programs and the computer's hardware. The purpose of this layer is (1) to protect the hardware from harmful software, and (2) to allow application programs to operate on the wildly different hardware devices in a uniform and reliable manner. It does both through the several *abstractions* it provides, which are: [[Processes]], [[Virtual memory]] and [[Files]].
