# Compilation phase

The second phase of the compilation process of a computer program. Takes a preprocessed source text file from the [[Preprocessing phase]], and translates it into an assembly-language program text file. Typically outputs files with the suffix `.s`. So for instance, if it took as input `hello.i` from the proprocessing phase, it would outpot `hello.s`.
