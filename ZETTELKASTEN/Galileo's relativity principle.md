# Galileo's relativity principle

One of classical mechanics's fundamental principles. It states that there are infinity many [[inertial frame]]s, and that space and time have the same properties in all of them, and the laws of motion are the same in all of them.

Another way to formulate this principle is to say that the laws of motion are invariant under *Galilean transformations*, which are transformations between two inertial frames of the form
$$\textbf r = \textbf r^{\prime}+ \textbf V t, \hspace{0.8cm}t=t^\prime.$$
The second equation expresses that time is the same in both frames, and this absoluteness of time is one of the foundations of classical mechanics.
