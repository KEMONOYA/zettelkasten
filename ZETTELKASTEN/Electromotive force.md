# Electromotive force

The term *electromotive force* (EMF) refers to the repulsive forces between free electrons generated by a difference in their concentration between two regions of a conductor (eg. wire).

This force is generated when [[voltage]] is applied between two terminals of a conductor, and it is responsible for the flow of electrical [[current]] in the circuit.

To get a closer look at how EMF is generated, and how it produces current, let's look at what happens when we connect the two terminals of a battery with a wire:

A battery, by design, houses some chemical reactions that cause free electrons to quickly build in number on the negative terminal of the battery. This creates a difference in the concentrations of electrons between the negative terminal and the positive one. The negative one now has a high concentration of electrons, all repelling each other and building up "electrical pressure." When a wire is connected between its terminals, the battery now has a chance to alleviate this pressure by letting the electrons out into the wire through the negative terminal. But when those electrons are poured out, they increase the concentration of free electrons inside the wire itself near the negative terminal, and they all repel one another, again causing pressure to build at that point. That pressure alleviates itself by pushing the neighboring electrons farther down along the wire (). That then builds up pressure at that new point, which alleviates itself by again pushing its neighboring electrons farther down, and so on, causing a chain reaction which is in fact the flow of [[current]] in the circuit. These repulsive forces are expressed as an almost instantaneous pulse that travels down the circuit.
