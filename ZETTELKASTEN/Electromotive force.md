# Electromotive force

The term *electromotive force* (EMF) refers to the repulsive forces between free electrons generated by a difference in their concentration between two regions of a conductor (eg. wire).

This force is generated when [[voltage]] is applied between two terminals of a conductor, and it is responsible for the flow of electrical [[current]] in the circuit.

To get a closer look at how EMF is generated, and how it produces current, let's look at what happens when we connect the two terminals of a battery with a wire:

A battery, by design, houses some chemical reactions that cause free electrons to quickly build in number on the negative terminal of the battery. This creates a difference in the concentrations of electrons between the negative terminal and the positive one. The negative one now has a high concentration of electrons, all
