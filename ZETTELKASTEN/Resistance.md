# Resistance

*Resistance* is defined to be the ratio of the [[voltage]] applied between two points, and the [[current]] that's generated from that voltage:
$$R= \frac{V}{I}.$$
This statement is called *[[Ohm's law]]*.  Resistance is measured in $\text{Ohms}$, defined by
$$1 \text{ Ohm} = \frac{1 \text{ Volt}}{1 \text{ Ampere}}.$$
The above definition of resistance describes resistance as a measure of "how much the material impedes the flowing current." That is, for a voltage of $5V$ applied across two different materials, if one material draws $5A$ while the other draws $10A$, then we know the first material is twice as resistive as the second.
