# Direction field

A field that assigns to every point in a given region on the plane a straight line passing through this point. It serves as the [[Phase velocity vector field]] for first-order [[Differential equation]]s (since the phase space here ). Therefore, the curves tangent to the direction field define solutions to the first-order differential equation; these curves are called [[Integral curve]]s.
