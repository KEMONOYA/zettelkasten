# Direction field

A field that assigns to every point in a given region on the plane a straight line passing through this point. When used in a one-dimensional phase space, it describes how the phase point is changing (its slope) at every position. It therefore defines the solutions to **first-order** [[Differential equation]]s, which are exactly the curves tangent to the direction field; these curves are called [[Integral curve]]s.

In particular, an equation of the form $\dot x = v(x,t)$, a first-order differential equation, defines *the direction field of $v$*. A solution to this equation with the initial condition $(t_0,x_0)$ is a function on the interval whose graph is an integral curve of this direction field and passes through the point $(t_0,x_0).$
