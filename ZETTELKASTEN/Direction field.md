# Direction field

A field that assigns to every point in a given region on the plane a straight line passing through this point. It defines the solutions to first-order [[Differential equation]]s, which are exactly the curves tangent to the direction field; these curves are called [[Integral curve]]s.

In particular, an equation of the form $\dot x = v(x,t)$, a first-order differential equation, defines *the direction field of $v$*. A solution to this equation is a function on the interval whose graph is an integral curve of this direction field.
