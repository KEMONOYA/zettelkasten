# Principle of Least Action

A principle upon which classical mechanics (and other fields of physics) can be built. It states that any mechanical system takes the path (in position-velocity phase space) which minimizes the action integral, which is defined (if the system takes the endpoint positions of the path $q^{(1)}$ and $q^{(2)}$ at times $t_1$ and $t_2$ respectively) by
$$S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}L(q,\dot q, t)dt,$$
where $L(q,\dot q, t)$ is called the [[Lagrangian]] of the system. This principle is a bit of a misnomer, since in reality the principle only requires the action integral to be stationary, not necessarily minimzed. It is also called Hamilton's principle.
