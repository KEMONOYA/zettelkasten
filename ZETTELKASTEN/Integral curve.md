# Integral curve

An integral curve is a curve that is tangent at each of its points to a vector field (or [[Direction field]]). In the context of a [[Phase velocity vector field]] or [[Direction field]] in a phase space, the integral curves represent the solutions to the [[Differential equation]] defined by the vector or direction field. 

Side note, the name "integral curve" is motivated by the fact that in certain cases, these curves can be found using the operation of integration.
