# Phase velocity vector field

A vector field defined on the phase space of an evolutionary process that specifies how the phase point is moving at each position in phase space.

This vector field defines a [[Differential equation]], whose solutions are the [[Integral curve]]s of the field.

I am UNSURE OF THIS, but my current understanding is that phase velocity vector fields serve the same purpose as [[Direction field]]s (), but they're applicable to differential equations of higher order than first, unlike direction field which only apply to first-order equations.
