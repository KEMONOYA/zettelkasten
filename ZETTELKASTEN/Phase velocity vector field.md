# Phase velocity vector field

A vector field defined on the phase space of an evolutionary process that specifies how the phase point is moving at each position in phase space.

This vector field defines a [[differential equation]], whose solutions are the [[integral curve]]s of the field.

I am UNSURE OF THIS, but my current understanding is that phase velocity vector fields serve the same purpose as [[direction field]]s (describing how the phase point is moving), but they're applicable to differential equations of higher order than first, and in phase spaces that are of higher dimension than 1, unlike direction fields which only apply to first-order equations, in 1-dimensional phase spaces.
