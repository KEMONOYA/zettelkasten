# Ohmic heating

When a voltage is applied across a component of a circuit and a current is drawn through it, some power is consumed by the component and the energy is both used to do work, and lost to some degree in the form of heat. The [[generalized power law]] can tell us the total power consumed by the component, but it can't tell us the forms of the energy it's converted into. It could be heat, light, magnetic field generation, etc.. 

When the component is a perfect resistor (purely ohmic in nature) though, we can be sure that the power consumed by it is completely converted into heat energy. This power lost due to heating in this case is called *Ohmic heating*. When (and only when) this is the case, we may combine the generalized power law with [[Ohm's law]] to get an expression for the power loss:
$$P = VI = I^2R.$$
