# Differential equation

A differential equation is an equation that relates a function to its derivatives.

The concept of a differential equation can be viewed from a geometric persepective however as an equation that defines a direction field in a phase space. The problem of finding solutions to the differential equation then is equivalent to the problem of finding the integral curves of that direction field.
