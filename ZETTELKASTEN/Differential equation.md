# Differential equation

The most enlightening viewpoint for differential equations is the *geometric* perspective. Geometrically, differential equations are equations defined by the [[Phase velocity vector field]] on the phase space of an evolutionary process (i.e. they are equations that describe the dependence of the motion of a phase point on its position).

The study of the evolutionary process then reduces to the study of the curves defined by the phase velocity vector field. In particular, the problem of finding the solutions to a differential equation then reduces to the problem of finding the phase curves defined by the phase velocity vector field.
