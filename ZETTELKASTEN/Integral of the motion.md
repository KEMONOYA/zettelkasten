# Integral of the motion

Integrals of the motion are functions of the coordinates and velocities in the system that do not change with time, and depend only on the initial conditions. There are, for a system of $s$ degrees of freedom, exactly $2s-1$ integrals of the motion. This is illuminated by the following argument:

A solution for a system of *s* degrees of freedom contains $2s$ arbitrary constants. Since closed systems do not depend on time explicitly, the origin of time is arbitrary and may always be taken as one of the arbitrary constants of the solution (we exclude time origin because it is not a function of the coordinates and velocities). That leaves $2s-1$ quantities. The equations of motion $m\text$
