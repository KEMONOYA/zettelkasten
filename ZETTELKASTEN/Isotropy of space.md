# Isotropy of space

A property found in [[inertial frame]]s. It is described by saying that every direction in space is mechanically equivalent. That is, there is no special direction in space. As a result, rotating a mechanical system in space has no effect on its laws of motion, and its equations of motion remain the same. 

An example of an anisotropic frame is this: imagine a frame accelerating in the positive $x$ direction. Now imagine a particle moving uniformly in the negative $x$ direction. That particle would appear to be accelerating, despite having no interactions. But now rotate the particle system 180 degrees and observe the result. Now the particle starts off moving in the positive $x$ direction, but appears to be decelerating as time goes on. This is different from the behavior in the first case, and so the behavior of the system changes with changing its orientation.
