# Fragment (OpenGL)

> A *fragment* in OpenGL is a collection of values produced by the [[rasterization stage]] of the [[graphics pipeline]] that represent information about a single "potential pixel" that may or may not be drawn later on the screen in the [[fragment shader]] stage (*depending on clipping, alpha, depth, etc.*).
