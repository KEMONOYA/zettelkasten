# Inertial frame

An inertial frame is a frame of reference in which space is homogeneous and isotropic, and time is homogeneous. It can also be identified as a frame in which a free particle moves uniformly.

It is the frame in which the laws of nature take their simplest form. If we just picked an arbitrary frame of reference, the laws of nature (equations of motion) would generally have very complicated forms (the frame could be accelerating in weird ways), but an inertial frame guarantees that we get to work with the simplest form we can get.
