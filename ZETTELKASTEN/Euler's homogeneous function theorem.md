# Euler's homogeneous function theorem

A function that is homogeneous of degree $k$ is a function $f$ that satisfies $f(\alpha x) = \alpha^{k}f(x)$, for some integer $k$ and every nonzero real number $\alpha$.

A *positively* homogeneous function is defined the same as above, except $\alpha$ is restricted to positive numbers only. 

Euler's theorem then states that if $f(x_{1},x_2,...,x_n)$ is postiviely homogeneous of degree $k$, and continuously differentiable in some open subset of $\mathbb R^n$, then
$$\sum \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}x_{i} = kf(x_1,x_2,...,x_n),$$
on that same subset of $\mathbb R^n$.
