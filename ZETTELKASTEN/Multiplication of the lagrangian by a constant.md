# Multiplication of the lagrangian by a constant

Multiplication of a [[Lagrangian]] by a constant obviously has no effect on the equations of motion it produces, since the constant is just divided out.

However in multiplying lagrangians by a constant, we cannot two noninteracting lagrangians by two different constants, since we can make a
