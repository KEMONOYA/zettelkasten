# Multiplication of the lagrangian by a constant

Multiplication of a [[Lagrangian]] by a constant obviously has no effect on the equations of motion it produces, since the constant is just divided out.

However in multiplying lagrangians by a constant, we cannot multiply two noninteracting lagrangians by two different constants, since [[Additivity of the lagrangian]] implies these lagrangians are actually just two distant parts of a "bigger" system's lagrangian. Hence it makes no sense to scale part of a composite system while keeping the other constant, or scaling it differently, the combination (the big system) must be scaled together as a whole. Think of it as starting with a composite system in which all masses are measured in kg, then multiplying only part of the system by 1000 to make its masses measured in grams. Now the ratios between the masses (which are all that matter in the definition of mass) are completely off. The system must be scaled as a whole to maintain the ratios between the masses.

And we can make the same argument for all lagrangians of all noninteracting systems making up the universe (the systems that do interact can just be grouped into one system to make it closed, then grouped with other isolated systems), therefore all lagrangians must be multiplied by the same constant simultaneously (since they are all parts of the "universe lagrangian").
