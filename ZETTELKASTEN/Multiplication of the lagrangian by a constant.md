# Multiplication of the lagrangian by a constant

Multiplication of a [[Lagrangian]] by a constant obviously has no effect on the equations of motion it produces, since the constant is just divided out.

However in multiplying lagrangians by a constant, we cannot multiply two noninteracting lagrangians by two different constants, since it is possible to make a mechanical system out of combining those first two systems, and by [[Additivity of the lagrangian]], the lagrangian of that combination will be the sum of their lagrangians. Hence it makes no sense to scale part of a composite system while keeping the other constant, or scaling it differently, the combination must be scaled together as a whole (think of it as measuring one part of the syst). And we can make the same argument for all lagrangians of all noninteracting systems making up the world (the systems that do interact can just be grouped into one system to make it closed), therefore all lagrangians must be multiplied by the same constant simultaneously.
