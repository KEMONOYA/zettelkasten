# Multiplication of the lagrangian by a constant

Multiplication of a [[Lagrangian]] by a constant obviously has no effect on the equations of motion it produces, since the constant is just divided out.

However in multiplying lagrangians by a constant, we cannot multiply one lagrangian by $\alpha$ and one lagrangian by a different constant $\beta$, because the [[Additivity of the lagrangian]] implies that the lagrangian $L$ made up of both systems together (assuming they're noninteracting) would equal $\alpha L_{A}+ \beta L_B$. But then the equations of motion produced from $L$ would not allow dividing out both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ simultaneously, so the equations differ from those given by the lagrangian $L_A+L_B$.
