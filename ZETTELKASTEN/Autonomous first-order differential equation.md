# Autonomous differential equation

A differential equation is called *autonomous* if it has no explicit dependence on its independent variable. The motivation for this concept is closed mechanical systems, systems that don't interact with any other systems and hence feature no dependence on time, since the laws of nature do not change

For instance, in the case of the equations of motion of a mechanical system, the equation of motion $\ddot x = F(x,\dot x)$ is autonomous since $F$ is independent of $t$.
