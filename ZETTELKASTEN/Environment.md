# Environment

An *environment* in a computer program is a part of the memory that stores name-object pairs, to keep track of what values are associated with what names in the program; such as in defining variables. This is used by interpreters when interpreting a program to make sense out of abstract symbols, associating them with their corresponding data or procedure.
