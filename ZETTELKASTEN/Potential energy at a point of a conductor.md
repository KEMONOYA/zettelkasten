# Potential energy at a point of a conductor

The [[potential energy]] at a point in a conductor represents the strength of the repulsion interactions between the electrons at that point; the "electrical pressure" that's built up at that point.

Points of high potential energy have a high concentration of electrons, all repelling one another
