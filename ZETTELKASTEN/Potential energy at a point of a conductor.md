# Potential energy at a point of a conductor

The [[potential energy]] at a point in a conductor represents the strength of the repulsion interactions between the electrons at that point; the "electrical pressure" that's built up at that point.

Points of high potential energy have a high concentration of electrons, all repelling one another, while points of low potential energy have little pressure built up, a lower concentration of electrons. When there is a difference in potential energy between two points in a circuit, the point of high energy attempts to alleviate some of its pressure by firing off electrons towards the lower potential energy point (or in other words, [[voltage]] breeds [[current]]).

A difference in potential energy between two points is caused when a load (resistor, device, etc.) is placed between the two points, because as electrons move through it, some of their potential energy is used up and transferred into heat energy, light energy, etc..
