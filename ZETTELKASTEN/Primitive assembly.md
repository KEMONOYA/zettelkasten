# Primitive assembly

> *Primitive assembly* is a stage of the [[graphics pipeline]] that follows the [[vertex shader]] (or the [[geometry shader]], if it is executed) stage, and serves the purpose of taking the collection of vertices produced from either of those previous stages and assembles all the points those vertices encompass when connected, forming the primitive shape.
