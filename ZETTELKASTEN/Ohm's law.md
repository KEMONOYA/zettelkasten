# Ohm's law

*Ohm's law* is an empirical statement about some materials and their resistivity. It is of the form
$$R = V/I,$$
that is, it states that the resistance of the material is the ratio of the applied [[voltage]] and the [[current]] that voltage draws.

Materials to which Ohm's law applies are called *Ohmic* materials, and they are those materials whose resistance is constant over a range of voltages, and it's given by the formula above. The figure below shows the constant slope $V$-$I$ relation charactertistic of Ohmic materials. 

Nonohmic materials have resistances that vary with voltages, such as diodes, whose resistance is zero when voltage is positive and very high when voltage is flipped to negative. Ohm's law does not apply here.
