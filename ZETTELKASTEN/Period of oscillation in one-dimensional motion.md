# Period of oscillation in one-dimensional motion

A [[Motion in one dimension]] can be integrated in a general from:
$$t = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}m}\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{E-U(x)}}+\text{constant}.$$

In a case where the equation $U(x) = E$ has two solutions (see the graph below), the particle oscillates between the positions of the two solutions to the equation, and is said to be stuck in a *potential well* between those two points. We can find the time taken for the particle to oscillate back and forth between these positions using the general solution above, so that the period $T$ is given by
$$T = 2\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}m}\int_{x_1}^{x_2}\frac{dx}{\sqrt{E-U(x)}},$$
keeping in mind that the time from position $x_1$ to $x_2$ is the same as $x_2$ to $x_1$, by the [[Isotropy of time]].
