# Virial theorem

The *virial theorem* states that if the potential energy of a system $U$ is a homogeneous function of degree $k$, and motion of the system takes place in a finite region of space, with finite velocities, then the following relation holds:
$$2\bar T = k\bar U,$$
where $\bar T$ and $\bar U$ are the time-average values of the [[kinetic energy]] and [[potential energy]] of the system respectively. See [[average value of a function of time]].

From this relation, we can make some notable inferences about some systems. First notice that $\bar T + \bar U = \bar E = E$. Then the following holds:
$$\bar U = 2E/(k+2),\hspace{0.7cm} \bar T=kE/(k+2),$$
which expresses $\bar U$ and $\bar T$ in terms of the total energy of the system $E$.

From this, a few useful facts can be deduced. In the case of *small oscillations* ($k=2$), $\bar U = \bar T$. The mean values of the potential and kinetic energies are equal. In the case of a *Newtonian interaction* ($k=-1$), $E = -\bar T$, expressing the fact that the motion only takes place in a finite region if the energy is negative ($\bar T$ is evidently always positive).
