# Geometry shader

> The *geometry shader* is an **optional** stage of the [[graphics pipeline]] that comes after the [[vertex shader]] stage. If executed, it takes as input a collection of vertices that form a primitive from the output of the vertex shader and adds new vertices to that collection, creating extra shapes.
