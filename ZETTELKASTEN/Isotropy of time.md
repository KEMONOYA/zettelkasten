# Isotropy of time

Time does not show up explicitly in the [[Lagrangian]] of a closed system. This means that if we replace the time $t$ with $-t$, the lagrangian is unaffected, and hence so are the equations of motion. What this means is that the system "played in reverse" satisfies the equations of motion of the original forward-moving system. In other words, the reverse of any motion in the original system is also a valid motion in the system, under some initial conditions.
