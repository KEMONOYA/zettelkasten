# Newton's equations

Newton's equations are the [[Differential equation]]s that serve as the equations of motion in Newton's formulation of classical mechanics. They are formulated in Newton's second law, and are of the form 
$$F(x,\dot x, t) = ma.$$
These equations express the expermental fact that [the acceleration at an instant is determined by the position and velocity at that instant](Mechanical%20state%20completely%20determined%20by%20initial%20positions%20and%20velocities.md).

They may also be derived in the Lagrangian formalism as a special case of [[Lagrange's equations]] by choosing the generalized coordinates to be Cartesian coordinates.
