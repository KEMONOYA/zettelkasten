# Lagrangian

A definite function of the coordinates and velocities of all particles in a system, and time, $L(q,\dot q, t)$ that characterises a mechanical system. It can be thought of as encoding all information about the mechanical system into one function, including motion of particles relative to one another and the interactions between them.

The fact that the Lagrangian is in terms of only coordinates and velocities expresses the fundamental experimental result that [the mechanical state of a system is completely determined by its coordinates and velocities at some instant.](obsidian://open?vault=Vaults&file=Monologue%2FZETTELKASTEN%2FMechanical%20state%20completely%20determined%20by%20initial%20positions%20and%20velocities)

The Lagrangian takes the form $L = T - U$ in a closed mechanical system, where $T$ is the kinetic energy, and $U$ the potential energy. If the system is not closed (i.e. moves in an external field) then this external field is accounted for as an explicit dependence on time in the potential energy $U$, and the form of the Lagrangian remains the same.
