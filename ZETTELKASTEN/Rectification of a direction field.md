# Rectification of a direction field

A *rectification* of a [[direction field]] is a diffeomorphism (smooth mapping) of the phase space **itself** that maps the direction field into a field of parallel directions. A direction field is said to be *rectifiable* if there exists a rectification of it.

Pictorially, a rectification can be thought of as smoothly bending or stretching the phase space (like it's an elastic sheet of paper) in a way such that the [[integral curve]]s of the direction field are all straightened out parallel to each other. It is important to note here that the thing we're bending is not the direction lines directly, but the space itself, and the direction lines only as a consequence of that.

A smooth direction field is always *locally* rectifiable. However, that need not extend to a global level, the whole space. Consider the following example:
