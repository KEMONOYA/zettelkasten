# Preference

A preference is a mathematical *ordering* of the set of all goods in existence. It describes which option is preferable to a given consumer between any two goods.

Preferences satisfy the following three assumptions:

1. **Completeness:** every good is included in the ordering. In other words, there is no good for which the consumer "has no opinion," or "doesn't know how much they value it." So for every two goods, the consumer can definitively say that they either prefer one to the other, *or* that they don't prefer one to the other but like the two options equally as much. 
 2. **Transitivity:** if the consumer prefers $A$ to $B$, and prefers $B$ to $C$, then they prefer $A$ to $C$.
 3. **Nonsatiation:** an extra unit of a good *always* makes the consumer more happy. In other words, **more is always better than less**. This is the essential assumption here, that makes Preferences a good economic model.
