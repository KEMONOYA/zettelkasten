A preference is a mathematical *ordering* of the set of all goods in existence. It describes which option is preferable to a given consumer between any two goods.

Preferences satisfy the following three properties:

1. **Completeness:** every good is included in the ordering. In other words, there is no good for which the consumer "has no opinion," or "doesn't know how much they value it."
