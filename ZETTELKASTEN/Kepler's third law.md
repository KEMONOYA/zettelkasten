# Kepler's third law

*Kepler's third law* states that in fields in which the [[potential energy]] $U$ is inversely proportional to the distance between two points (eg. Newtonian attraction between masses, Coulomb interaction between charges), the square of the time of revolution in the orbit is proportional to the cube of the size of the orbit:
$$\left(\frac{t^\prime}{t}\right)^2  = \left(\frac{l^\prime}{l}\right)^3.$$
This means that, for example, the time taken to complete a revolution around the Sun by a planet increases rapidly as that planet gets farther away from the Sun, and its orbit gets bigger.

This can be proven using [[Mechanical similarity]], exploiting the fact that the potential energy in this case is a homogeneous function.
