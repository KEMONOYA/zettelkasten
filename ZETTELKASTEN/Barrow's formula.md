# Barrow's formula

Barrow's formula gives the solution (the [[integral curve]]) to a first order differential equation (respectively, [[direction field]]) of the form $\dot x = v(t)$ with the initial condition $(t_{0},x_0)$, and it is of the form
$$\varphi(t) = x_{0} + \int_{t_0}^t v(\tau)d\tau.$$
It is also applicable in first-order differential equations of the form $\dot x = v(x)$. See [[autonomous differential equation]]s.

It is based on Barrow's theorem (the fundamental theorem of calculus) that expresses the mutually inverse relationship between differentiation and integration, since this differential equation above can be viewed as defining the direction field (which gives the slope of the integral curve) as a function of time, and hence we have the derivative of the solution curve as a known function of time. The problem of finding the solution now reduces to the problem of integrating this derivative, which is what Barrow's formula does.
