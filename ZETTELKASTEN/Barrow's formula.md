# Barrow's formula

Barrow's formula gives the solution to a first order differential equation with the initial condition $(t_{0},x_0)$ that is invariant along side straight line on its dir, and it is of the form
$$\varphi(t) = x_{0} + \int_{t_0}^t v(\tau)d\tau.$$
The form of the differential equation $\dot x = v(t)$ implies that Barrow's formula 

It is based on Barrow's theorem (the fundamental theorem of calculus) that expresses the mutually inverse relationship between differentiation and integration.
