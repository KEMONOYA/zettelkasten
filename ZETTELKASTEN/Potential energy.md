# Potential energy

A quantity found in the langrangian of a system of interacting particles. It is a function of the coordinates of the particles only, and can be thought of as encoding into the lagrangian the interactions between the particles. 

The "energy" part of its name stems from the fact that it is one of the two quantities making up the **mechanical energy** of the system.
