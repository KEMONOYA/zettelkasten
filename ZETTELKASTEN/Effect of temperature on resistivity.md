# Effect of temperature on resistivity

[[Resistivity]] of a material increases when its temperature increases. This is because a temperature increase means more vibrations of the lattice atoms in the material, which means more collisions with electrons, impeding their movement.

Within a certain temperature range, most metals' resistivity $\rho$ at a temperature $T$ is given by:
$$\rho = \rho_0[1+\alpha(T-T_0)],$$
where $\rho_0$ is a reference resistivity at temperature $T_0$, and $\alpha$ is the *temperature coefficient of resistivity* measured in units of ${1}/{^o}\text{C}$, and it's also an intrinsic property constant for eac
