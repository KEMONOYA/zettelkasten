# Law of composition of velocities in classical mechanics

This describes how velocities transform when we move from one inertial frame to another. 

If a frame $K^\prime$ moves with velocity $\textbf V$ with respect to frame $K$, then a particle moving with velocity $\textbf v^\prime$ in $K^\prime$ would be moving with velocity $\textbf v = \textbf v^{\prime}+ \textbf V$ in $K$.

This way of composing velocities holds as a consequence of the foundational **absoluteness of time** in classical mechanics. The absoluteness of time states that all events happening in one inertial frame must occur at exactly the same time in all other inertial frames. For this to happen, velocities must transform this way between them.

As an example, consider a pirate standing on his ship's deck, in front of a spot on the ground marked by an X. The pirate drops a ball from 1m above the ground, it falls in a straight line and  touches the X one second after (let's assume the ball moves at constant velocity 1m/s in the negative $y$ direction for simplicity).  Another observe standing still on shore now observes this event happening, and relative to him the ship is moving at 1m/s in the positive $x$ direction.

For the ball to touch the X one second after dropping in the shore man's frame, like it did in the pirate's, the ball must move 1m to the right (since the ship, and thus the X, move to the right), and 1m down simultaneously, in one second, to touch the X in the right place at the right time. Clearly then the ball's velocity becomes $1i - 1j$ (which is $v^{\prime}+V$), and it moves a distance of $\sqrt{2}$ in one second to touch the X. Hence we see that the law of composition of velocities given above is the one that satisfies the absoluteness of time.
