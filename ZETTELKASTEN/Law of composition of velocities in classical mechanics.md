# Law of composition of velocities in classical mechanics

This describes how velocities transform when we move from one inertial frame to another. 

If a frame $K^\prime$ moves with velocity $\textbf V$ with respect to frame $K$, then a particle moving with velocity $\textbf v^\prime$ in $K^\prime$ would be moving with velocity $\textbf v = \textbf v^{\prime}+ \textbf V$ in $K$.

This way of composing velocities holds as a consequence of the foundational **absoluteness of time** in classical mechanics. The absoluteness of time states that all events happening in one inertial frame must occur at exactly the same time in all other inertial frames. For this to happen, velocities must transform this way between them.

As an example, consider a pirate standing on his ship's deck, in front of a spot on the ground marked by an X. The pirate drops a ball from 1m above the ground, it falls in a straight line and  touches the X one second after (let's assume the ball moves at constant velocity 1m/s for simplicity)
