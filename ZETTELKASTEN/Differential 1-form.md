# Differential 1-form

Consider a curve in the $(t,x)$-plane, and let $\textbf A$ be a velocity vector attached at some point on the curve, describing how the curve is changing. A *differential 1-form* $\omega$ is defined to be a linear real-valued function of this vector $\textbf A$. 

Two examples of differential 1-forms on this curve are $dt(\textbf A)$ and $dx(\textbf A)$, defined as the projections of the vector on the $t$ and $x$ axes respectively, and they describe the rate of change of each coordinate under the motion of $\textbf A$.
