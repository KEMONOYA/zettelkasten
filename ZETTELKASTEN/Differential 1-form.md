# Differential 1-form

Consider a curve in the $(t,x)$-plane, and let $\textbf A$ be a velocity vector attached at some point on the curve, describing how the curve is changing. A *differential 1-form* $\omega$ is defined to be a linear real-valued function of this vector $\textbf A$. 

Two examples of differential 1-forms on this curve are $dt(\textbf A)$ and $dx(\textbf A)$, defined as the projections of the vector on the $t$ and $x$ axes respectively, and they describe the rate of change of each coordinate under the motion $\textbf A$.  
If the curve under consideration is smooth and $\textbf A$ is tangent to it, it is easy to see then that the ratio ${dx(\textbf A)}/{dt(\textbf A)}$ equals the derivative of the curve $dx/dt$ at this point of tangency.

Every differential 1-form $\omega$ in the $(t,x)$-plane can be written as $a \hspace{0.1cm} dx + b \hspace{0.1cm} dt$, where $a$ and $b$ are functions in the plane.

The purpose of differential forms in general is to define integrands over curves, surfaces, solids and higher-dimensional manifolds in a unified way. The differential 1-form is the instance of that general concept for curves specifically. That is, differential 1-forms can be integrated over.
