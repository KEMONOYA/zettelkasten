# Magnetic dipole

>A **magentic dipole** is, in plain terms, a 'very tiny magnet.' More precisely, a magnetic dipole is a source of a magnetic field (e.g. electric circuit, bar magnet), with its size taken to the zero limit.

It's convenient to visualize a magnetic dipole as an infinitesimally small bar magnet, with the magnetic field lines pointing from the south pole to the north pole inside the magnet.
