# Conservation of power in circuits

As a consequence of the law of conservation of [[energy]], the power (loss) in the circuit is conserved (recall that power is defined as the work, or energy transferred, per unit time). That is, the total power loss in the circuit is constant with time and is equal to the sum of the power loss in the individual components in the circuit.
