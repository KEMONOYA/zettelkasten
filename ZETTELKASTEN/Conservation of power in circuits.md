# Conservation of power in circuits

In circuit analysis, circuits are assumed to be closed (isolated) systems, ignoring the details of energy supplying by the battery and energy loss through the circuit in favor of simplifying the study of how energy flows through the circuit internally. The voltage sources are not included in this closed system since they actively increase the energy in the system, only the components and the wires connecting them are. Rather, the [[energy]] in the circuit is kept constant by virtue of the fact that the energy provided by the battery is all lost throughout the circuit, used up by the components in different ways. 

Recall that power is defined to be the rate of transfer of energy. Another way, then, to restate the above is that the *power* supplied to the circuit by the source equals the total power lost (used) in the individual components of the circuit:
$$P_{source}=\sum\limits_i P_{i},$$
where the sum is over the components, and the powers on both sides of the equation are given by the [[generalized power law]]. This statement expresses the *conservation of power* in a circuit.
