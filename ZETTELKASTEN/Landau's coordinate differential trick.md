# Landau's coordinate differential trick

Often we wish to calculate the quantity $v^2$ for a particle in a mechanical system, to use in the kinetic energy term in the [[lagrangian]] $L = \sum \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} - U(\textbf r)$.  Landau provides a trick for writing the expression of $v^2$ in different coordinate systems (cartesian, spherical, cylindrical, etc.). 

Observe that $v^{2}= ({dl}/{dt})^{2}= (dl)^2/(dt)^2$, where $dl$ is an infinitesimal displacement arc length. So if we find $dl^2$, we can just divide it by $dt^2$ to get $v^2$. This is especially handy because infinitesimal displacement elements can always be treated as straight lines, even if their finite counterparts would be curved.
