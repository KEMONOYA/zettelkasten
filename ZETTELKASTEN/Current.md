# Current

The *current* is defined to be the total charge $\Delta Q$ passing through an area $A$ of a conductor in the time $\Delta t$. In other words, it's "how much charge is flowing through the conductor per unit time."
$$I_{\text avg} = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}.$$

When the amount of charge passing through the slice of area varies with time ($Q = Q(t)$), the current is defined to be the amount of charge $dQ$ passing through the area in the infinitesimal time $dt$:
$$I = \frac{dQ}{dt}.$$

Current is generated in a conductor when there is a difference in potential energyâ€” a [[Voltage]]â€” between its terminals.
