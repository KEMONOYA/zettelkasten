# Internal energy

A system's internal energy $E_i$ is its [[Energy]] when the system is at rest as a whole. That is, it is the system's energy in the frame in which its [[Center of mass]] is at rest. This energy is composed of the [[Kinetic energy]] of the system's particles' relative motion and the [[Potential energy]] of their interactions.
