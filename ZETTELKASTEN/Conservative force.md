# Conservative force

A force is a called *conservative* if it can be written as negative the gradient of a potential field $U(\textbf x)$. So in Landau's notation, this'd be $F = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial \textbf x}$.

A special feature of conservative forces is that the force, like the potential field, is here a function of coordinates only. This means that by [[Newton's equations]] $F(\textbf x) = ma$, the acceleration depends only on the coordinate vectors, and not the velocities. (This is not necessarily the case in nonconservative forces, see drag forces for example, where force depends on velocity).
