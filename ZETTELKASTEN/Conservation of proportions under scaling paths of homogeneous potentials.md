# Conservation of proportions under scaling paths of homogeneous potentials

When a path in a system whose potential energy $U$ is a homogeneous function is scaled, and the time is scaled with it such that [[Mechanical similarity]] applies, the proportions of $\text{"portion of total time elapsed}:\text{portion of total distance covered"}$ in the two paths (before scaling and after) are the same. That is to say, if for example half the complete path is covered in 3/4 the total time taken to cover that full path in the unscaled case, then after scaling, again half the new scaled path is covered in 3/4 the total time taken to cover that new path.

This follows from the fact that the ratio between the times is a power of the ratio between the linear dimensions, when the two paths are mechanically similar:
$$\frac{t^{\prime}}{t} = \left(\frac{l^{\prime}}{l}\right)^{1-\frac{1}{2}k},$$
where $k$ is the degree of homogeneity of $U$. Notice then that we can choose to focus on only a portion of the full path and apply the above relation to it, and it holds all the same. The full path and any portion of it are obviously scaled by the same factor.

Following the above example, if we know a path $l$ is half-covered by a particle in 3/4 of the total time $t$, then if we apply the above relation to only that half portion of the path, we see that the time taken to cover that half-path after scaling (by, say, 7) equals $7^{1-\frac{1}{2}k}\cdot\frac{3}{4}t$, where $t$ is the time taken to cover the original full path. Similarly, the full path after scaling is covered in $7^{1-\frac{1}{2}k}\cdot t$. Hence, we see that the proportion of the time taken to cover half the path over the time to taken to cover all of it is the same both before and after scaling, both $\frac{3}{4}$. So in both cases, half the path is covered in 3/4 times the time of the full path. This is what we mean by conservation of proportions.

As a result of this conservation of proportions, it makes sense to talk about "corresponding points on the path at corresponding times," since equal proportions are covered in equal times.
