# Conservation of proportions under scaling paths of homogeneous potentials

When a path in a system whose potential energy $U$ is a homogeneous function is scaled, and the time is scaled with it such that [[Mechanical similarity]] applies, the proportions of $\text{portion of total time elapsed}:\text{portion of total distance covered}$" between the two paths (before scaling and after) are the same.
