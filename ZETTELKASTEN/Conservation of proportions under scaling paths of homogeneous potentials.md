# Conservation of proportions under scaling paths of homogeneous potentials

When a path in a system whose potential energy $U$ is a homogeneous function is scaled, and the time is scaled with it such that [[Mechanical similarity]] applies, the proportions of $\text{"portion of total time elapsed}:\text{portion of total distance covered"}$ between the two paths (before scaling and after) are the same. That is to say, if for example half the complete path is covered in 3/4 the total time taken to cover that full path in the unscaled case, then after scaling, again half the new scaled path is covered in 3/4 the total time taken to cover that new path.

This follows from the fact that the ratio between the time is a power of the ratio between the linear dimensions, when the two paths are mechanically similar:
$$\frac{t^{\prime}}{t} = \left(\frac{l^{\prime}}{l}\right)^{1-\frac{1}{2}k},$$
where $k$ is the degree of homogeneity of $U$. 

Following the above example, if we know a path $l$ is half-covered by a particle in 3/4 of the total time $t$, then if we apply the above relation to only that half portion of the path, we see that the time taken to cover that half-path after scaling equals $\fra$
