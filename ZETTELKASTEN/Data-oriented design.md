# Data-oriented design

Data-oriented design (DOD) describes writing programs in a way that is very conscious of how its data should be stored in memory, caches and registers, maximizing time-efficiency in retrieving and maniplating data. This approach is very useful when designing real-time systems like game engines and interactive physics simulations.
