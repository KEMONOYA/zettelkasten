# Homogeneity of time

A property of [[Inertial frame]]s. It is described by saying that every instant in time is mechanically equivalent. That is, the laws of nature are the same at every point in time. Letting a system execute its motion now, and letting it execute its motion 3 weeks from now should yield the same results.
