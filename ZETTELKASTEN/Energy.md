# Energy

Energy is a numerical quantity that does not change over time in a closed mechanical system. It is an abstract quantity that has no concrete physical picture, it is merely a quantity.  

It comes in various forms (kinetic, gravitational potential, heat, electrical, nuclear, etc.), and energy in a system may change between these forms over time, but its total quantity is nonetheless conserved. It is this conservation that makes energy special, and worth our attention, because it means energy serves as an
