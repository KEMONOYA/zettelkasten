# Energy

Energy is a numerical quantity that does not change over time in a closed mechanical system. It is an abstract quantity that has no concrete physical picture, it is merely a quantity. It has the form 
$$ E = T+U,$$
where $T$ is the kinetic energy, and $U$ is the [[potential energy]] of the system.

It comes in various forms (kinetic, gravitational potential, heat, electrical, nuclear, etc.), each with its own formula, and energy in a system may change between these forms over time, but its total quantity is nonetheless conserved. Meaning if we sum up the contributions of each form of energy in a system at any point in time, we'll always end up with the same total. It is this conservation that makes energy special, and worth our attention, because it means energy serves as a [[Conserved quantity]], whose additive property makes it extremely useful in studying interactions in mechanical systems.
