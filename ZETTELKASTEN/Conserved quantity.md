# Conserved quantity

A conserved quantity is an [[Integral of the motion]] that has the special properties of:
1. being derived from the fundamental symmetries of space-time: [[Homogeneity of space]], [[Isotropy of space]] or [[Homogeneity of time]], and
2. being additive for parts of the system that don't interact

There are *seven* conserved quantities in total for a closed system: the three components of linear [[momentum]], the three components of [[angular momentum]], and [[energy]].
