# Conserved quantity

A conserved quantity is an [[integral of the motion]] that has the special properties of:
1. being derived from the fundamental symmetries of space-time: [[homogeneity of space]], [[isotropy of space]] or [[homogeneity of time]], and
2. being additive for parts of the system that don't interact

There are *seven* conserved quantities in total for a closed system.
