# Lagrangian of a free particle

The form of the [[Lagrangian]] for the simplest system, a system of one free particle, is $L = \frac{1}{2} mv^2$.

We can derive this form using [[Galileo's relativity principle]]. Start with an inertial frame $K$ moving relative to another inertial frame $K^\prime$ with infinitesimal velocity $\boldsymbol \epsilon$, so that the velocity of the particle in frame $K^\prime$ is related to that of $K$ by $\textbf v^{\prime}= \textbf v + \boldsymbol \epsilon$. 

Since the frames are inertial, we know that the lagrangian of a free particle in frame $K$ is of the form $L(v^2)$, it depends only on the square of the velocity. By Galileo's relativity principle, the equation of motion of the particle is the same in both frames, so the lagrangian $L^\prime$ of the system in frame $K^\prime$ can differ from $L(v^2)$ of $K$ only by the total time derivative of a function of coordinates and time. Transforming the lagrangian of $K$, we get
$$L^{\prime}= L({v^\prime}^{2})=L(v^{2}+2 \textbf v \cdot \boldsymbol \epsilon + \epsilon^2),$$
and expanding the last side in powers of $\epsilon$ up to first order terms, we get
