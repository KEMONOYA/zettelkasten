# Energy of a moving system

The [[energy]] of a system whose [[center of mass]] moves with velocity $\textbf V$ relative to the given inertial frame is the sum of the [[internal energy]] of the system, and the energy of its motion as a whole:
$$E = E_{i}+\frac{1}{2}\mu V,$$
where $E_i$, the internal energy, is the energy of the system in a frame in which it is at rest, and $\mu$ is the total mass of the system, which is the sum of the masses of all particles.
