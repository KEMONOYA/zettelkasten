# Additivity of the lagrangian

The [[Lagrangian]] has the property of being additive for noninteracting parts of a system. That is, if a mechanical system is composed of two parts $A$ and $B$ which would have lagrangians $L_A$ and $L_B$ respectively if closed, then the limit of the whole system's lagrangian $L$ as the distance between the parts increases so much that they don't interact becomes 
$$\lim L = L_{A}+ L_B.$$
This property implies that **each of the noninteracting parts' equations of motion cannot contain quantities pertaining to the other part**. Why? Because if for example $B$ did contain quantities pertaining to $A$, then the additive property implies that the equation of motion for a quantity from $A$ obtained from the lagrangian $L_A$ differs from the equation obtained from the lagrangian of the whole system $L$. This cannot be if the two parts are truly noninteracting and do not affect one another.
