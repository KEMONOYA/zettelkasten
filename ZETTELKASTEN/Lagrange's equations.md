# Lagrange's equations

A set of 2*s* second-order [[differential equation]]s in $q(t)$ that describe a mechanical system of *s* degrees of freedom. They are of the form
$$\frac{\partial L}{dq} - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q} = 0,$$
where $L$ is the [[Lagrangian]] of the system. These equations can be derived from the [[Principle of least action]].
