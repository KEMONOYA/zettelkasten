# Motion in one dimension

A mechanical system is said to move *in one dimension* if it has only one degree of freedom. The [[Lagrangian]] of such a system is in general of the form
$$L = \frac{1}{2}a(q)\dot q^2-U(q).$$
In the case of a Cartesian coordinate (say, $x$), the lagrangian becomes
$$L = \frac{1}{2}m\dot x^2-U(x).$$
In this case, the motion of the system is solvable in a general form,
