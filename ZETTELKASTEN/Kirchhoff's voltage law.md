# Kirchhoff's voltage law

*Kirchhoff's voltage law* (or *KVL*) states that the [[voltage]] across any branch in a parallel connection is the same as the voltage across all the other branches. In other words, the sum of the voltage drops across one branch equals the sum of voltage drops across any of the other branches, and they're all just equal to the voltage between the two ends of the connection $V_{\text{AB}}$.
