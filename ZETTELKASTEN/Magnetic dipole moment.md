# Magnetic dipole moment

> The **magnetic dipole moment** (or simply *magnetic moment*) is a vector quantity representing both the *strength* and *direction* of a [[magnetic dipole]]. That is, the magnetic dipole moment (both its magnitude and orientation relative to the magnetic field's) of a magnetic dipole determines how much torque it *experiences* when it enters a magnetic field.
