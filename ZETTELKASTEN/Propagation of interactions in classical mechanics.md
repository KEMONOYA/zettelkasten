# Propagation of interactions in classical mechanics

In classical mechanics, interactions are propagated instantaneously. We see this in action in the form of the potential energy $-U(\textbf r_{1}, r_{2}, \bdots)$ This fact is closely related to the foundations of classical mechanics, namely [[Galileo's relativity principle]] and the absoluteness of time. 

If the velocity of propagation were finite, then by the [[law of composition of velocities in classical mechanics]], it would be different in different inertial frames.
