# Propagation of interactions in classical mechanics

In classical mechanics, interactions are propagated instantaneously. We see this in action in the form of the potential energy in the lagrangian $L = T-U(\textbf r_{1}, r_{2}, ...)$, where a change in one of the particles' position instantly affects all the others. This fact is closely related to the foundations of classical mechanics, namely [[Galileo's relativity principle]] and the absoluteness of time. 

If the velocity of propagation were finite, then by the [[Law of composition of velocities in classical mechanics]] (which is based on the absoluteness of time), it would be different in different inertial frames. And keep in mind that the velocity of propagation is constant in a frame. Which means if it is measured to be 5m/s in one interation, then all other interactions in that frame propagate at 5m/s.

With this in mind, we see why this varying of propagation velocity across frames causes problems:

Imagine two interacting particles at rest next to each other with some distance in between. Now imagine the first one moves slightly, which sends out an interaction "signal" to the other particle and affects it, say with velocity 9m/s. Now take another frame moving relative to the first in a way such that its propagation velocity is measured to be 123m/s from that first experiment. So, *any* interaction in this new frame propagates at 123m/s. Now if we set up the same experiment in this frame by looking at two new particles that are at rest (relative to this new frame, not relative to the old one) and placing them the same distance apart, the system should be indistinguishable from the one we had in the first frame. And yet the interaction when the first particle moves is propagated significantly faster this time, and the second particle is affected a lot sooner. This means that the laws of motion of the system are different depending on the frame, which contradicts [[Galileo's relativity principle]].
