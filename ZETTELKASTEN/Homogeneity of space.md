# Homogeneity of space

A property of space found in [[Inertial frame]]s. It is described as all points of space being mechanically equivalent. In other words, the laws of nature (equations of motion) do not change when the system is shifted as a whole to another place in space.

An example of a frame in which space is *inhomogeneous* is this: imagine you are a decapitated head that's still alive somehow, viewing a free particle from above while you are tied to the ceiling and rotating uniformly about the center of your head. If the particle were directly below your eyes, i.e. in the center of the frame, it would appear to remain in place forever with no motion ($\ddot x = 0$). If the particle started from somewhere off the center though, it would appear to rotate in a circle of fixed radius from the center forever ($\ddot x = \omega^{2}x$). Even though it is free of forces. Thus we see that changing the location of the system changes its equations of motion, and hence how it behaves.
