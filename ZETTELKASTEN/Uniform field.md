# Uniform field

A uniform field is one in which the force $\textbf F$ acting on the particle at any point is the same. Knowing the definition of force is $\textbf F = -\partial U / \partial \textbf r$, we see that in such a field, the [[potential energy]] must have the form $U = -\textbf F \cdot \textbf r$ (since the partial derivative above being independent of $\textbf r$ implies $U$ must be linear in $\textbf r$, and also equal to $\textbf F$ in the end).
