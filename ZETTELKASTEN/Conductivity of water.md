# Conductivity of water

There is a misconception that all water conducts electricity. This is not true. Let's take a look at the different cases:

###### Distilled water
Distilled (pure) water is actually a very good *insulator* of electricity. This is because unlike metals, which depend on free *electrons* in their lattices to generate current, water depends on free *ions*. But distilled water, having no impurities, has a very small number of ions to facilitate [[current]] flow. The little number of ions it has comes from the usual autoionization of water into $\text{H}_3\text{O}^{+}$ and $\text{OH}^{-}$ ions at room temperature, and the ions amount to one for every $10^{7}$ $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ molecules.

###### Tap water
Unlike distilled water, tap water may have some impurities (which ionize in water) mixed in, though they vary in number. These impurities give rise to conductivity, so tap water does not function as an insulator, but its conductivity varies depending on the amount of impurities. For this reason, tap water can potentially be a serious shock hazard if it happens to have a high impurity count.

###### Saltwater
The salt in saltwater dissolves (ionizes) into many free ions, making saltwater a lot more conductive than the previous two cases.

###### Sugarwater
Sugar molecules have covalent bonds, not ionic ones, so no free ions are produced from the presence of sugar. Hence, much like distilled water, sugar water is not conductive.


The video in the References section demonstrates the proportion between the conductivities of all these cases of water. Below is a table containing two examples of the ones above, with some comments on each. Notice the proportion between the conductivity (or inversely, resistivity) in the case of pure versus salt water.
