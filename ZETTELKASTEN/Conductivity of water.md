# Conductivity of water

There is a misconception that all water conducts electricity. This is not true. Let's take a look at the different cases:

###### Distilled water
Distilled (pure) water is actually a very good *insulator* of electricity. This is because unlike metals, which depend on free *electrons* in their lattices to generate current, water depends on free *ions*. But distilled water, having no impurities, has a very small number of ions to facilitate [[current]] flow. The little number of ions it has comes from the usual autoionization of water into $\text{H}_3\text{O}^{+}$ and $\text{OH}^{-}$ ions at room temperature, and the ions amount to one for every $10^{7}$ $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ molecules.

###### Tap water
Unlike distilled water, tap water may have some impurities (which ionize in water) mixed in, though they vary in number. These impurities give rise to conductivity, so tap water does not function as an insulator, but its conductivity varies depending on the amount of impurities. For this reason, tap water can potentially be a serious shock hazard if it happens to have a high impurity count.

###### Saltwater
