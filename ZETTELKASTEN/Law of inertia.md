# Law of inertia

The law of inertia states that in an [[inertial frame]], any free particle moves with a velocity constant in both magnitude and direction.

###### How do we derive this fact from first principles?
Consider a particle moving freely (i.e. interacts with nothing) in an inertial frame. By [[homogeneity of space]] and [[homogeneity of time]], we know the [[Lagrangian]] of this system cannot contain either the coordinate vector $\textbf r$ or the time $t$ explicitly. It is therefore a function of only the velocity $\textbf v$. But also by [[isotropy of space]], it cannot depend on the direction of $\textbf v$ either. Hence it depends only on the magnitude of the velocity, $\textbf v^{2}= v^2$.

Since the lagrangian $L(v^2)$ doesn't depend on $\textbf r$, [[Lagrange's equations]] take the form
$$\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \textbf v} = 0.$$
This then means that $\partial L/\partial \textbf v= \text{constant}$, as time goes on. But since $\partial L /\partial \textbf v$ is a function of the velocity only (and it must have some explicit dependence on $\textbf v$ since $L$ is not linear in $\textbf v$ so the derivative doesn't eliminate it), this must mean that the velocity itself is constant as time goes on, otherwise $\partial L /\partial \textbf v$ would vary with time. Hence we reach that $\textbf v = \text{constant}$, which is the law of inertia.
