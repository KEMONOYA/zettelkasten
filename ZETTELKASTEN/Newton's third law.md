# Newton's third law

Newton's third law expresses the equality of action and reaction in a closed system. That is, for each force acting on a particle in the system, there is another force acting on the first force's source particle that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

This is derived from the law of conservation of [[momentum]], as we see that differentiating the equation $\sum\limits m_{a}\textbf v_{a}= \text{constant}$ with respect to time, and using [[Newton's equations]], gives us 
$$\sum\limits \textbf F_{a}= 0.$$
So for a system of two particles, this would mean $\textbf F_{1}= -\textbf F_2$.
