# Mnemonic rule for solution of autonomous differential equation

A mnemonic rule for remembering the formula for the general solution of [[autonomous differential equation]]s is to write out the equation itself $\dot x = v(x)$ as $\frac{dx}{dt} = v(x)$, and then while treating $dx$ and $dt$ as [[differential 1-form]]s, bring all the $x$'s to the right-hand side, and the $t$'s to the left. We end up with $dt = dx/v(x)$. This is an equality between two differential forms, and it's saying that when evaluating th
