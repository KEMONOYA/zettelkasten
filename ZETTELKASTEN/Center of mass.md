# Center of mass

The center of mass of a mechanical system is a point in space representing the average weighted (by mass) position of all the particles in the system. This center of mass moves with different velocities in different inertial frames, its motion represents the "motion of the system as a whole" and it is usually of great help in calculations to pick a frame in which the center of mass is at rest, since the motion of the center of mass itself is of no interest to us.  

The position vector of the center of mass is written as
$$\textbf R = \frac{\sum\limits m_{a}\textbf r_a}{\sum\limits m_a},$$
where the sum is over the particles in the system.
Similarly, the velocity of the center of mass is written as
$$\textbf V = \frac{\sum\limits m_{a}\textbf v_a}{\sum\limits m_{a}}= \frac{\textbf P}{\sum\limits m_a}.$$
We see here that the relation between the velocity of the system as a whole and its momentum is similar to that for a single particle of mass $\mu = \sum\limits m_a$. This result expresses the *additivity of mass*.

Additionally, we can see that the law of conservation of [[momentum]] is equivalent to stating that the center of mass of the system moves with uniform velocity in a closed system.
