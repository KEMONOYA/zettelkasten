# Voltage

*Voltage* between two points of a circuit is defined as the energy needed to transfer a unit charge from the first point to the second. Or equivalently, the energy lost in transfering a unit charge between the two points. Mathematically, this means
$$\Delta V = \frac{\Delta U}{q} \hspace{0.2cm}\text{ or }\hspace{0.2cm}V_{AB}=V_{A}-V_{B}=\frac{U_{A}-U_{B}}{q},$$
where $U$ is the [[potential energy at a point of a circuit]], direction of current is assumed to be the conventional (Franklin) direction and test charges $q$ are assumed positive.

A voltage must exist between two points of a circuit to get electrical [[current]] to flow between them. In other words, when a voltage exists between two terminals of a conductor (such as a wire), an *[[electromotive force]]* (EMF) is generated which pushes the electrons along and gives rise to the current. Thinking of EMFs is a more practical way to visualize voltages than using the definition given above.

As we track the potential energy at points through a *load* (resistor, lamp, etc.), we'll find that its potential energy decreases as we go across the terminals of the load. This is because as electrons go through the load, some of their potential energy is lost (in the form of heat, light, etc.) and so the "electrical pressure" they exert on the electrons around them becomes lower, the further down the load they are (see figure below). As a result of this, there arises a difference between the two terminals of the load; a *voltage*, or *voltage drop*, as we call it.
