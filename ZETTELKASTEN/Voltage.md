# Voltage

*Voltage* between two points of a circuit is defined as the energy needed to transfer a unit charge from the first point to the second. Mathematically, this means
$$\Delta V = \frac{\Delta U}{q} \hspace{0.2cm}\text{ or }\hspace{0.2cm}V_{AB}=V_{A}-V_{B}=\frac{U_{A}-U_{B}}{q},$$
where $U$ is the [[potential energy at a point of a circuit]], direction of current is assumed to be the conventional (Franklin) direction and test charges $q$ are assumed positive.

A voltage must exist between two points of a circuit to get electrical [[current]] to flow between them. In other words, when a voltage exists between two terminals of a conductor (such as a wire), an *[[electromotive force]]* (EMF) is generated which pushes the electrons along and gives rise to the current.
