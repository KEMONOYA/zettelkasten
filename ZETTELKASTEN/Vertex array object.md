# Vertex array object

> A *vertex array object* (*VAO*) is a type of [[OpenGL object]] that stores a set of [[vertex attribute]] configurations. In other words, it carries information about what vertex attributes are enabled, which VBOs they read from, and in what format they're supposed to read from them.
