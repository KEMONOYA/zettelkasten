# Generalized power law

The *generalized power law* gives an expression for the power loss across any circuit, given the voltage drop across it and the current flowing through it (both of which can be measured using devices). The formula of the law is:
$$P = VI.$$

It is derived by substituting in $W = \Delta U$ in the definition of power $P = dW/dt$. Keeping in mind that, from the definition of [[Voltage]], $\Delta U = Vq$, we get
$$P = \frac{dW}{dt} = V\frac{dq}{dt} = VI.$$
