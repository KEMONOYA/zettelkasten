# Generalized power law

The *generalized power law* gives an expression for the *power* loss (measured in $\text{Watts}$) across any circuit, given the voltage drop across it and the current flowing through it (both of which can be measured using devices). It is called the *generalized* power law because it applies regardless of the material type of the conductor, or the nature of the charge movement. The formula of the law is:
$$P = VI,$$
where $V$ is the [[voltage]] across the terminals of the circuit, and $I$ is the [[current]] flowing through it.

It is derived by substituting in for the work $W = \Delta U$ in the definition of power $P = dW/dt$. Keeping in mind that, from the definition of [[Voltage]], $\Delta U = Vq$, we get
$$P = \frac{dW}{dt} = V\frac{dq}{dt} = VI.$$

This law also provides us an alternative way to define a $\text{Volt}$, which is
$$1\text{ Volt} = \frac{1 \text{ Watt}}{1 \text{ Ampere}},$$
in other words: "how much power an amp of current delivers to the circuit."
