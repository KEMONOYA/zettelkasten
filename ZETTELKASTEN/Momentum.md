# Momentum

A [[conserved quantity]] in a closed mechanical system. It is defined as the sum $\textbf P = \sum\limits m_{a}\textbf v_a$. From this definition, we see that unlike the energy, it is additive for each particle in the system's momentum $m_{a}\textbf v_a$, regardless of whether or not the particles interact.

Conservation of momentum (and equivalently, the definition of momentum itself) is derived from the fundamental [[homogeneity of space]] in [[inertial frame]]s, by virtue of which the [[Lagrangian]] of the system is unaffected by a translation in space.
