# Mechanical similarity

Mechanical similarity is a technique that applies to some mechanical systems, using which we can make inferences about the behavior of the system without even integrating the equations of motion. It is based on the fact that the equations of motion are unaffected under [[multiplication of the lagrangian by a constant]].

Namely, mechanical similarity applies in systems where the potential energy $U$ is a homogeneous function of degree $k$. In such systems, it allows us to determine ratios between the mechanical quantites of two paths in the system which are geometrically similar but different in size, as powers of the ratio between the lengths of the two paths. So for instance, in a system where a particle revolves around the origin in a circle in a fixed plane, mechanical similarity can be used to determine
- a ratio between the time taken for a particle to revolve a path at a distance $r=1$ and another at a distance $r=2$
- a ratio between the angular momenta of the two particles, at corresponding points on their paths, at corresponding times
- a ratio between the linear momenta of the particles
- a ratio between the energies of the particles
- etc.
as a ratio of the
