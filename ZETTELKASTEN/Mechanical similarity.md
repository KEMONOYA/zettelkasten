# Mechanical similarity

Mechanical similarity is a technique that applies to some mechanical systems, using which we can make inferences about the behavior of the system without even integrating the equations of motion. It 

[[Multiplication of the lagrangian by a constant]] does not affect the equations of motion. This fact allows us, in some special cases, to make inferences about the behavior of the system in question without even integrating the equations of motion.

Such special cases include the case where the potential energy $U$ is a homogeneous function of degree $k$. Let's work this out and see
