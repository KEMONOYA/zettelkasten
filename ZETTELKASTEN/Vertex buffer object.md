# Vertex buffer object

> A *vertex buffer object* (*VBO*) is a type of OpenGL object that represents a region of the GPU's memory that holds [[vertex]] data. Storing vertex data in a *VBO* allows for the GPU to access this data quickly and efficiently, instead of waiting for it to be sent from the CPY.
