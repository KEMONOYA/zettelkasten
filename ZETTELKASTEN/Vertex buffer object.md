# Vertex buffer object

> A *vertex buffer object* (*VBO*) is a type of OpenGL object that represents a region of the GPU's memory which holds [[vertex]] data. Storing vertex data in a *VBO* allows the GPU (e.g. the [[vertex shader]]) to access this data quickly and efficiently, instead of waiting for it to be sent from the CPU, which takes a considerable amount of time.
