# Fragment shader

> The *fragment shader* is a stage of the [[graphics pipeline]] that follows the [[rasterization stage]]. Its main purpose is to take a [[fragment]] produced by rasterization and calculate its final color. The fragment shader usually contains data about the 3D that it uses to calculate this color, such as lighting information and shadows.
