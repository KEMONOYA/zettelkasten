# Conductivity

*Conductivity* is a measure of how good a material is at conducting electricity. Notice that it is an intrinsic property of the material itself, and is not affected by the dimensions of the material sample we choose to use. It is defined as the multiplicative inverse of the [[Resistivity]] of the material:
$$\sigma \equiv \frac{1}{\rho}.$$
Conductivity is measured in units of *siemens* $\text{S} = (\Omega \text{m})^{-1}$.
