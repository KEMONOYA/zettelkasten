# Indifference curve

Indifference curves (abbr. IC) serve as a graphical representation of [[preference]]s. An individual IC is made up of all the points of combinations of goods (which we'll call bundle points) for which the consumer is equally happy, i.e. doesn't prefer one to the other. So, all points on an IC have equal utility. There is then an ordering of ICs based on preference, as consumers prefer higher ICs (ICs whose bundle points have higher utility) to lower ones, as stated by the nonsatiation property of preferences.

To formalize the above, we state the properties of ICs as follows:

1. Consumers prefer higher ICs. *See the first figure below.*
2. ICs slope down. If they sloped upwards, it would violate the nonsatiation property of [[preference]]s. *See the second figure below.*
3. ICs never cross. If they did, it would violate the transitivity property of [[preference]]s. *See the third figure below.*
4. Exactly one IC passes through every bundle point. This follows from the completeness property of [[preference]]s.
